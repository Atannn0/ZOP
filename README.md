# Trust in Artificial Intelligence Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the trust in artificial intelligence (AI) based on survey responses. The analysis includes statistical tests and visualizations to explore the relationship between demographic factors, emotions, and trust in AI across different decision-making scenarios. The goal is to understand the factors influencing trust in AI and identify key patterns.

## Files
- **`trust.py`**: The main Python script that:
  - Loads and preprocesses survey data.
  - Conducts statistical tests such as Chi-square, T-tests, and Wilcoxon tests.
  - Generates insightful visualizations like bar charts, histograms, and KDE plots to represent findings.
- **`Důvěryhodnost umělé inteligence (Odpovědi)-4.xlsx`**: The Excel file containing the survey responses, which include demographic details, trust ratings, and feedback on AI.

## Features
- **Demographic Analysis**: Evaluates how age, education, and technical skills influence emotions toward AI.
- **Trust and Transparency**: Measures how transparency in AI processes affects trust levels.
- **Scenario-Based Trust**: Compares trust levels in AI across everyday decision-making and sensitive domains like health and finance.

## Dependencies
- **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **`matplotlib`**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **`scipy`**: For statistical tests.
- **`seaborn`**: For making statistical graphics.
